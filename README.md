#Description

- NOTE: requires Jfoenix (https://github.com/jfoenixadmin/JFoenix) and Java FX v11+ to run. To run, open in Intellij as a project and add the JFoenix and JavaFX jars as libraries. You could try instead retrieving these packages via Maven if you wish however I have not tested this, however it is something I am looking to implement soon

- Credit for the original text file for questions and answers goes to https://github.com/nodanaonlyzuul/against-humanity, I have changed the questions and answers slightly here and there. 
- Server client game similar to cards against humanity written in Java FX (note I am not affiliated with cards against humanity in any way and I am not profiting from this project at all, it is simply for fun and educational purposes. Feel free to make use of the source code however you please).
